## Internship Gamundo

My internship at Gamundo. They were developing the game Panzer Pets, an MMO style game where players could collect robot parts to build their robots and use them to fight other players or AI. The first few weeks I worked on the UI. We later switched to a spin-off type game which was going to be a shooter. I worked on modifying existing Unity plugins to add extra options like dual wielding weapons.
