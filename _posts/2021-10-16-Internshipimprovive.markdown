## Internship ImproVive

My internship at ImproVive. They were developing a digital comic, with minigames in between, build to be read and played in the browser. I worked on the programming of the minigames. We developed three of them during my time here. I also wrote my thesis on optimizing performance of web-based applications like these on different devices and hardware.
